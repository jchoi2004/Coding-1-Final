This website is designed for tourists and people who want to know a little bit about myself and the experience at Yellowstone National Park.

<ul> Some of the features of the website include:
    <li>A carousel showing a few pictures of what Yellowstone looks like</li>
    <li>A deer logo design to represent Yellowstone Park</li>
    <li>An about us page that tells a little bit about me and my experience there</li>
    <li>A contacts page that is styled</li>
</ul>

Thank you for taking a look at this website. With the limited time and resources, I was able to create this website with the intentions of assisting others to learn about my experience at Yellowstone National Park.
I encourage you to take a look and enjoy the website! It is a very cool place to check out.
